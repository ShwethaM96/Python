    Python is most interesting and easy scripting language. Anyone can regardless of one's academics.
    I,myself being EEE graduate learnt Python with all interest which i felt easier compared to other coding language.
    Here, Am just showing How I started with Python,from Basics to my Personal Projects.

#How to print a statement
print('Hello World')

#How to assign a value to a variable
a=5        # 5 is an integer,'a' is a variable. 5 is stored in a.
print(a)
b='Python' # 'Python' is a string stored in a variable 'b'.
print(b)
a=6        # Now 6 is an integer stored to a variable 'a'. when you print a, it returns 6,not 5.
print(a)


#Arithamtic operation
#with numbers

x=2
y=3
print(x+y)      #Addition
print(x-y)      #Substraction
print(x*y)      #Multiplication
print(x/y)      #Division returning floating number
print(x//y)     #Division returning an integer
print(y%x)      #Returns Reminder


#With Strings
c='Hi'
d='Shwetha'
print(c+d)       #Returns HiShwetha without a space
print(c+ ' '+d)  #Returns Hi Shwetha
#print(c+a)      #Return Type error since you can't add num and string
print(str(a)+' '+d) #Returns 6 Shwetha
